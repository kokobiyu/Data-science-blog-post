# Data-science-blog-post

![screenchot](Screenshot.png)

this is project for Udacity course
I use numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries
My curiosity about the data science job's salaries has got me to write this blog
I put my code in note book called 'Blog Post.ipnyb' and the file in 'ds_salaries.csv'
The result can give us sume insight about the salary of data-related jobs
Iâ€™d like to thank ai-jobs.net Salaries for aggregating this data!

Here's the blog post
